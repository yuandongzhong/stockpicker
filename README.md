# Real-Time Stock Picker

A Python program that monitors over 1600 public companies from the China stock market in real-time. I used SQLite to store and update historical data and used multi-processing to make the program fast enough so that a single computer can generate a stock picking report periodically in seconds.

 ## Technologies and languages used
 Python, LXML, Pandas, Multiprocessing, and SQLite.
